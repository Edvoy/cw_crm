## Introduction
This project is one of my first steps as a developer. It is the application of recently acquired knowledge on Django and Python. It was done in a week and a half and will maybe be used as a basis for a future project.
## Features

All the basic features expected for the foundation of a CRM :

* **Companies profil** — manage your address book : create, read, delete and update with automatic mail synchronization. All contact per company are easily accessible.
* **Companies profil** — manage your address book : create, read, delete and update with automatic mail synchronization.
* **Communication archive** — Filter your emails by contact or company.
